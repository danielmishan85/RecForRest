# RecForRest
Android application for recommendations for restaurants in Israel. Users will need to register for the app. That is, to open a user. After that, every existing user will have the option to post their recommendation for the restaurant they stayed at.
When a user wants to post a recommendation, he will have to write down his opinion and his experience with the restaurant. And in addition, he will be able to add photos of the dishes he ate and what he most recommends, so that the people who are in the application will be able to get a first impression of the restaurant they choose.
